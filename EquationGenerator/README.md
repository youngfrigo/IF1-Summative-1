# Equation Generator Quiz Documentation

## Introduction

The Equation Generator program is a simple program that generates a certain number of basic equations in the form of:

                                                        a * x = b

The program assigns random integers to a and x between 1 and 10, and then provides the opportunity for the user to submit an answer for x.

After validating the user’s answer, the program display’s a relevant message in the window; “Correct!” if the user’s answer matches the correct answer for x, and “Incorrect. The correct answer was x” is the user’s answer does not match the correct answer.

The user has one attempt at each question, and their score is tracked throughout the quiz. Once the final equation is answered, a button to see final score is displayed, and once clicked will display the user’s final score out of the total number of questions.
